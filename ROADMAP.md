# Roadmap

This document contains the currently planned features for Serve. It's meant to be a rough guide of where I want to take the project. Things might change, get moved around, etc.

## Short-term

-   [x] CLI tool to run commands inside containers
-   [x] Add command palette
-   [] Read log files (Laravel specific)
-   [] Handle queues
-   [] Compile assets with Node
-   [] Execute terminal commands
-   [] GUI for Artisan + other actions (Laravel specific)

## Long-term

-   [] Support Windows & Linux
-   [] Recipe system. Move all Laravel specific code into a recipe and create recipes for other frameworks.
