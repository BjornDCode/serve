# Contributing

All contributions are welcome, but it might be a good idea to open an issue before spending time on a PR that won't get merged.

If you are working on Windows or Linux, any testing is much appreciated.

If you have experience with Rails, Django, Phoenix, Symphony, WordPress, or any other framework, I would like to discuss supporting it in Serve.
